== Options

The optional capabilities specified in this clause depend on the required capabilities specified in clause <<_base>> above.
Each subclause of this clause defines an indivisible module of functionality that can be used in GeoPackages. These modules are referred to as options.
GeoPackages MAY use one or more options defined in this section.
GeoPackages MAY omit the tables for options that are not used.
As a minimum, a GeoPackage SHALL contain one user data table as defined by the Features or Tiles options in clauses <<features>> and <<tiles>> respectively.

[requirement]
A GeoPackage SHALL contain features per clause <<features>> and/or tiles per clause <<tiles>> and row(s) in the `gpkg_contents` table with lowercase `data_type` column values of “features” and/or “tiles” describing the user data tables.
